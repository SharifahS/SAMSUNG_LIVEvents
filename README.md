<h1>Poject Summary</h1>
<p>
Epiqvision held a virtual reality event developed to the specifications given out by the client, in this case SAMSUNG. 
This event took place over a six day period. Over the course of these six days, users were asked to play a variety of games. 
Data was collected to document everything that happened, including individual results for each game.
</p>
<p>
When the event was over, json files were pulled from the platform and then converted into csv files for further transformations. 
</p>
<p>
Data collected included the Leaderboard (a collection of all scores for each player ranking them from highest to lowest), 
and the actual game results showing who played what games and their respective scores. The software used to transform and analyze this data include excel & jupyter notebook. 
</p>
<p>
Keeping in mind the clientâ€™s (SAMSUNG) wishes, the files were transformed to reflect a more focused dataset shown in the RESULTS folder. 
</p>
<p>
Setbacks - data for the first 5 days was collected together but the 6th day had been collected separately, requiring an unconventional merge for both Leaderboard and Game results.
